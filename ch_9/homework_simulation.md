## Homework (Simulation)

This program, lottery.py, allows you to see how a lottery scheduler
works. See the README for details.

Questions

>1. Compute the solutions for simulations with 3 jobs and random seeds
of 1, 2, and 3.

```
Here is the job list, with the run time of each job:
  Job 0 ( length = 1, tickets = 84 )
  Job 1 ( length = 7, tickets = 25 )
  Job 2 ( length = 4, tickets = 44 )


Here is the set of random numbers you will need (at most):
Random 651593
Random 788724
Random 93859
Random 28347
Random 835765
Random 432767
Random 762280
Random 2106
Random 445387
Random 721540
Random 228762
Random 945271
```

```
** Solutions **

Random 651593 -> Winning ticket 119 (of 153) -> Run 2
  Jobs:
 (  job:0 timeleft:1 tix:84 )  (  job:1 timeleft:7 tix:25 )  (* job:2 timeleft:4 tix:44 )
Random 788724 -> Winning ticket 9 (of 153) -> Run 0
  Jobs:
 (* job:0 timeleft:1 tix:84 )  (  job:1 timeleft:7 tix:25 )  (  job:2 timeleft:3 tix:44 )
--> JOB 0 DONE at time 2
Random 93859 -> Winning ticket 19 (of 69) -> Run 1
  Jobs:
 (  job:0 timeleft:0 tix:--- )  (* job:1 timeleft:7 tix:25 )  (  job:2 timeleft:3 tix:44 )
Random 28347 -> Winning ticket 57 (of 69) -> Run 2
  Jobs:

  Jobs:
 (  job:0 timeleft:0 tix:--- )  (* job:1 timeleft:4 tix:25 )  (  job:2 timeleft:0 tix:--- )
Random 721540 -> Winning ticket 15 (of 25) -> Run 1
  Jobs:
 (  job:0 timeleft:0 tix:--- )  (* job:1 timeleft:3 tix:25 )  (  job:2 timeleft:0 tix:--- )

  Jobs:
 (  job:0 timeleft:0 tix:--- )  (* job:1 timeleft:1 tix:25 )  (  job:2 timeleft:0 tix:--- )
--> JOB 1 DONE at time 12

>2. Now run with two specific jobs: each of length 10, but one (job 0)
with 1 ticket and the other (job 1) with 100 (e.g., -l 10:1,10:100).
What happens when the number of tickets is so imbalanced? Will
job 0 ever run before job 1 completes? How often? In general, what
does such a ticket imbalance do to the behavior of lottery scheduling?

The job with the higher amount of tickets will almost always win.  
1/100 chance. The scheduling becomes unfair for lower ticket jobs.

>3. When running with two jobs of length 100 and equal ticket  allocations of 100 (-l 100:100,100:100), how unfair is the scheduler?
Run with some different random seeds to determine the (probabilistic) answer; let unfairness be determined by how much earlier one
job finishes than the other.

The scheduler is quite fair, as length is higher but quantum size is lower.

>4. How does your answer to the previous question change as the  quantum size (-q) gets larger?

A larger quantum size is less fair relative to the job length.

>5. Can you make a version of the graph that is found in the chapter?
What else would be worth exploring? How would the graph look
with a stride scheduler?

In stride scheduling, fairness would be reached quicker.
